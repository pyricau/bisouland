Bisouland is a free online strategy-game: Take your opponents love points by
sending them kisses!

For now the only thing you can do is register and see your love points grow...
By don't panic! new updates should come soon to make the game more and more
interesting.

## A bit of history

Bisouland was first created by Pierre-Yves Ricau in 2005. You could send kisses
to your opponents, jump from cloud to cloud to escape them and eat soup to
become a better person.

After failing to release a second version, the game became a bit obsolete and
full of unfixed bugs (you could be kissed and gain love points, and have a
negative number of kisses).

In 2011, he open sourced a some players took over: Marc Epron, Thomas Gay and
Loïc Chardonnet. A second version was finally released in 2012, based on the d20
system. However, this version was more a prototype than a real game, as you
couldn't register and had to share characters in order to play.

This third version is a reboot which aims at bringing back the first version.

## Good luck and have fun!

I hope you'll like this game as much as me.
