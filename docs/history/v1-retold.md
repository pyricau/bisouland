# BisouLand v1: A Complete History (2005-2012)

*An archaeological synthesis of official articles, chat logs, and ranking data*

---

## Prologue: What Was BisouLand?

BisouLand was a French browser-based game where players competed by sending kisses
("bisous") to accumulate points and climb the rankings.

Part idle game, part social experiment, it combined RPG-like progression mechanics
with an adorably absurd premise: competitive kissing on pink clouds.

## Part I: Genesis (February - April 2006)

### The Launch

**February 20, 2006**

BisouLand opens its doors with a "Rose bonbon" (candy pink) design created by **Piwaï**,
the game's creator and sole developer.
What began as a personal project would grow into a community spanning six years.

Within days, the core mechanics were in place:
- **Hearts** (coeurs): generate love points over time
- **Mouths** (bouches): construct kisses
- Three kiss types: **Smack**, **Baiser**, and **Baiser langoureux**

The early days were marked by frantic bug-fixing.
Players discovered exploits—refreshing the page could restart constructions.
Piwaï patched and iterated rapidly.

### The Clouds Take Shape

**March 5-6, 2006**

The game world expanded dramatically.
Players were now placed on "nuages" (clouds), floating platforms with 16 spots each.
Kisses became weapons, you could steal your neighbours' Love Points by kissing them.

The full tech tree emerged:
- **Organs**: Heart, Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, Legs
- **Kisses**: Various types with different power levels
- **Techniques**: Apnea, Surprise, Spit, Jump

> "on peut embrasser ses ennemis ou pas"
> (Can we kiss our enemies or not? The eternal question.)
> _kiruathecat, March 2006_

### First Blood

**July 12, 2006**
The first recorded Top 20 shows **Blade** at #1 with 1.26 million points.
**Petrus** lurks at #3. The competitive era has begun.

### Balance and Reset

**April 26-30, 2006**
Piwaï reworks construction times with an exponential curve.
Level 50 heart now takes 7 days.

The changes are dramatic enough to warrant a full player reset:
max level 20 heart, 10M points, 2000 score.

A new contributor emerges: **Dorian** provides a fresh design on April 30th.

## Part II: The Golden Age (Summer 2006 - 2007)

### The Rise of Champions

The summer of 2006 saw the first great power struggles:

| Date   | Score  | #1 Player |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Jul 12 | 01.26M | Blade |
| Aug 25 | 02.08M | georgeabitbol |
| Oct 04 | 07.71M | georgeabitbol |
| Dec 06 | 16.90M | Petrus |

**georgeabitbol**, named after the cult character from "La Classe Américaine"
("l'homme le plus classe du monde"), briefly claimed the throne.

But **Petrus** was rising, and would become the game's most enduring legend.

### Drama on the Clouds

**July 2006** brought the first recorded rivalry:

> "george... c'etait MA proie! t'as bien attendu que je pete les BL pour passer!"
> — kapwee

kapwee accused george of swooping in on their target.
George responded by asking who wanted to see kapwee "se casser les dents" on him.

Meanwhile, **MoutonLover** expressed what every BisouLand player secretly felt:

> "moi je veux qu'on arrete de m'attaquer pour pouvoir être maitre du monde :p"
> (Me, I want people to stop attacking me, so I can be master of the world)

### Alliance Politics

The **PNA** (Pacte de Non-Agression) alliance formed, offering protection to its members.
Players debated the consequences of attacking alliance members.
These early political structures would shape gameplay for years.

### Admin Life

**May 14, 2006**: Development pauses as Piwaï faces university exams.

**August 8, 2006**: A major announcement, BisouLand v2 is coming!
Piwaï promises a complete code rewrite with cleaner architecture and admin tools.
A preview appears at bisoutest.piwai.info.

> _Note_: see `v2-dev`

**August 17, 2006**: Piwaï turns 20.

**September 7, 2006**: Piwaï enters INSA de Rouen engineering school.
Development slows significantly.

### The Grind Becomes Real

Chat logs reveal the brutal reality of late-game progression:

> "7653h pour le niveau 43"
> — Anonymous player

That's **319 days** of real-time waiting for a single level.
The "Soupe" (Soup) mechanic reportedly took 500+ hours to complete.

---

## Part III: The Long Maintenance (2007-2010)

### V2 Stalls

**March 29, 2007**

Piwaï confirms what players suspected: v2 development has stalled due to studies.
Version 1 will continue indefinitely.

### Petrus Reigns Supreme

Throughout this era, **Petrus** dominated the rankings:

| Date     | Petrus Score | Rank |
|----------|--------------|------|
| Jan 2008 |        33.3M |   #1 |
| Jun 2009 |        42.0M |   #2 |

At 42 million points, Petrus was so feared that someone created an account called **"killpetrus"**.

### The Great Lag of 2008

**January 2008**

Players report severe performance issues:

> "je sais pas chez vous mais chez moi le site lagg à mort!"
> (I don't know about you, but for me the site is extremely slow!)
> _cat_loic_

Petrus identified the culprit:

> "Ptet que c'est depuis l'avènement de skooliz.com, hébergé sur le même mutualisé"
> (Might be due to skooliz.com success, they use the same host)

Shared hosting with another site was killing performance.

### The Admin's Gift

**December 2007**: In a moment of generosity (or perhaps as a farewell gesture),
the admin offered up nearly 187 million Love Points:

> "Viendez donc me vider, j'ai 186791311 PA :p et je m'en sers pas ;)"
> (Come and get me, I've got 186,791,311 Love Points, and I don't even use them)

### Rise of the New Guard

**June 2009** marked a seismic shift.

**bite** appeared at #1 with 139.6 million points, more than triple Petrus's total.
The old scoring paradigm had shattered.

bite would reach 300M points by September 2009, then 500M by January 2010.
The ultimate grinder (unless... he was somehow cheating? ;o) ).

Meanwhile, **cat_loic** steadily climbed from #13 (December 2006) to #1 (July 2008),
representing the patient, long-term players who outlasted the flashier competitors.

---

## Part IV: The Decline (2010-2011)

### Signs of Decay

**August 2010**: New players arrive asking "c quoi le but de ce jeu?"
(what's the goal of the game?) but find fewer experienced players to answer.

**September 2011**: The veterans grow nostalgic:

> "Ya plus vraiment de challenge en même temps..."
> (there's no challenge anymore)
> _cat_loic_

> "L'alliance me manque"
> (I miss the alliance)
> Neko

Player counts dwindled. "on est 6 mouhahaha" (we are 6) became cause for celebration.

### The Old Guard Falls

The original champions had long since departed:
- **Blade**: #1 at launch, out of Top 20 by April 2007
- **georgeabitbol**: #1 in 2006, vanished completely after early 2007
- **Darkness**: Top 6 in 2006-2007, out by 2009

### New Blood

October 2011 saw massive turnover: 9 new players entered the Top 20 in a single snapshot
**kismi**, **ZEAS**, and **facepalm** emerged as the new power players.

---

## Part V: Rebirth (2011-2012)

### Community Takeover

**May 29, 2011**: A historic moment.
Piwaï transfers BisouLand to community management. Three players step up:

- **ZEAS**
- **facepalm**
- **cat_loic**

The code becomes **Open Source**.
They promise gradual improvements rather than disruptive changes.

### Version 2 Finally Arrives

**May 2, 2012**: Six years after the original announcement, **v2.0.0** launches.
Built with **Symfony2** and **Skeleton CSS**, it represents a complete rebuild.

**May 14, 2012**: **v2.1.0** adds the Population feature, responsive design, and automated love point decay.

### Version 1: Final Statistics

The old system's final numbers:
- 64 clouds
- 2,415 members
- 1,413,695,139,948 score points (trillions!)
- 2,340,853,121,625.77 love points

### The Last Leaderboard

**May 22, 2012** — Final recorded Top 20:

| Rank | Player   |  Score |
|------|----------|--------|
| #1   | kismi    | 287.5B |
| #2   | cat_loic | 151.0B |
| #7   | Petrus   | ~25.0B |

Petrus, present in all 16 recorded snapshots across 6 years, finally rests at #7.

## Epilogue: The Final Message

**January 21, 2012**: The last recorded chat message:

> "bonne année à tous"
> (happy new year to all)
> _kismi_

A quiet goodbye to a simpler era of web gaming.
