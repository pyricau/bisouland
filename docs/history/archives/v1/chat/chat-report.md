# BisouLand Archaeological Report (2006-2012)

A comprehensive analysis of chat logs recovered from BisouLand, a French browser-based kissing game.

## Overview

BisouLand was a French browser game where players competed by sending kisses ("bisous") to accumulate points and climb the rankings. The game featured RPG-like progression mechanics wrapped in an adorably absurd premise.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Systems
- **Coeur (Heart)**: Main stat for leveling up
- **Jambes (Legs)**: Movement/travel ability
- **Nuage (Cloud)**: Alternative travel method
- **Soupe (Soup)**: A mysterious mechanic that took 500+ hours to complete
- **PA (Points d'Action)**: Action points used for activities
- **BL**: The game's currency/kiss units

### Progression
- "Attacking" meant kissing someone to steal their points
- Upgrade times were brutal - one player reported "7653h pour le niveau 43" (319 days!)
- Jump costs increased with heart level, number of kisses, and distance
- Players could join alliances for protection (notably the "PNA")

## Notable Players

### The Legends
- **Petrus** - Dominant force throughout the game's history. At one point held 42 million points. So feared that someone created an account called "killpetrus"
- **bite** - The ultimate grinder. Reached 300M points (September 2009), then 500M points (January 2010)
- **georgeabitbol** - Named after the cult French film character from "La Classe Américaine" ("l'homme le plus classe du monde")
- **cat_loic** - Active community member, One Piece fan, also ran a webcomic site
- **grandbeb** - Climbed to 2nd place by October 2006, engaged in friendly rivalry with georgeabitbol

### Late Era Champions (2011-2012)
- **kismi** - Returned to find the game "bien boté" (well-evolved)
- **ZEAS** - Rose to top 3 by November 2011
- **Facepalm** - Briefly hit 2nd place in October 2011

## Community Drama & Rivalries

### The kapwee vs george Incident (July 2006)
> "george... c'etait MA proie! t'as bien attendu que je pete les BL pour passer!"

kapwee accused george of swooping in on their target. George responded by asking who wanted to see kapwee "se casser les dents" on him.

### Alliance Politics
- The PNA (Pacte de Non-Agression?) alliance was active
- Players asked about consequences for attacking alliance members
- By 2011, alliances had faded: "L'alliance me manque" lamented Neko

### The Admin's Gift (December 2007)
> "Viendez donc me vider, j'ai 186791311 PA :p et je m'en sers pas ;)"

The admin offered up nearly 187 million action points to anyone willing to travel across the map to collect them.

## Cultural Observations

### Language
Heavy use of French SMS-speak characteristic of the era:
- "slt" = salut
- "mdr" = mort de rire (lol)
- "pk" = pourquoi
- "g" = j'ai
- "k" = qu'
- "ui" = oui
- "tjrs" = toujours

### Pop Culture References
- One Piece fans gathered in February 2007: "bidon jour!!!" (Luffy's catchphrase)
- Monty Python spam sketch recreated by cat_loic in March 2011
- References to OGame (another browser game of the era)

### Memorable Quotes

> "la vie est belle, les poussins sont jaunes, et bisouland est rose"
> — cat_loic, December 2007

> "C'est pas qu'on est pas connecté, c'est juste qu'on parle pas XD"
> — Rukia63, August 2007

> "moi je veux qu'on arrete de m'attaquer pour pouvoir être maitre du monde :p"
> — MoutonLover, July 2006

> "on peut embrasser ses ennemis ou pas"
> — kiruathecat, March 2006

## Technical Issues

### The Great Lag of 2008
In January 2008, players reported severe lag issues:
> "je sais pas chez vous mais chez moi le site lagg à mort!"
> — cat_loic

Petrus identified the cause: "Ptet que c'est depuis l'avènement de skooliz.com, hébergé sur le même mutualisé" - shared hosting with another site was killing performance.

## The Decline (2010-2012)

### Signs of Decay
- August 2010: New players asking "c quoi le but de ce jeu?" with fewer experienced players to answer
- September 2011: "Ya plus vraiment de challenge en même temps..." — cat_loic
- September 2011: "L'alliance me manque" — Neko, nostalgic for the old days
- Player count dwindled: "on est 6 mouhahaha" became cause for celebration

### Final Entry
The last recorded message, January 21, 2012:
> "bonne année à tous"
> — kismi

A quiet goodbye to a simpler era of web gaming.

## Conclusion

BisouLand represents a fascinating snapshot of French internet culture in the late 2000s. It combined simple browser game mechanics with a vibrant community that formed rivalries, alliances, and friendships over the shared absurdity of competitive kissing. The gradual decline from active drama to nostalgic silence tells the familiar story of countless browser games of that era - loved intensely, then quietly abandoned as the internet moved on.
