Take your opponents love points by sending them kisses!

Bisouland is a free online strategy-game. In order to play you only need a
web browser.

## Installation

To install Bisouland, [check the requirements](doc/02-requirements.md) and then
download and use its installation script:

### Administration access

The administration area is protected using
[`.htaccess` and `.htpasswd` files](http://weavervsworld.com/docs/other/passprotect.html).

First of all, create them:

    cp web/news/.htaccess.dist web/news/.htaccess
    touch web/news/.htpasswd

Then simply set the absolute path of the project in the `web/news/.htaccess`
file, and put a
[generated password](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/) in the
`web/news/.htpasswd` file.

### Emailing

Now that everything is configured, check email sending for registration and
newsletter.
