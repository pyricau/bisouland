# Bisouland

Bisouland is a free online strategy-game. In order to play you only need a
web browser.

Take your opponents love points by sending them kisses!

## Installation

To install Bisouland, first get its sources:

    git clone git://github.com/pyricau/bisouland.git

Then follow these 3 small steps to configure it.

### Project configuration

Bisouland needs database access and administrator/expeditor emails. To provide
them, create the configuration file:

    cp web/config/parameters.php.dist web/config/parameters.php

Then open the `web/config/parameters.php` file and fill in the blanks (`''`)!

### Administration access

The administration area is protected using
[`.htaccess` and `.htpasswd` files](http://weavervsworld.com/docs/other/passprotect.html).

First of all, create them:

    cp web/news/.htaccess.dist web/news/.htaccess
    touch web/news/.htpasswd

Then simply set the absolute path of the project in the `web/news/.htaccess`
file, and put a
[generated password](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/) in the
`web/news/.htpasswd` file.

### Emailing

Now that everything is configured, check email sending for registration and
newsletter.

## Structure

Every request will go to the Symfony2 application. If the route is not found
in it, the legacy application will be boostraped.

**Warning**: the legacy application, which lies in the `web` directory,
has been created in 2005 by a someone who was learning web development.
Therefore it probably contains security holes, bugs, low quality code
and bad design pattern.
