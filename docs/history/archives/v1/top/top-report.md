The 2011 snapshot shows massive turnover - 9 new players in the top 20.

## Key Findings

1. **Only 3 players** appeared in both the first and last snapshots: Petrus, yazzz (appeared mid-2007), and angellina666

2. **Score growth was exponential** - the game likely introduced mechanics that created hyperinflation

3. **The "old guard"** (Blade, georgeabitbol, totalbmx, larve_attitude) was completely replaced by 2008

4. **Late 2011 saw a major shift** - possibly a server merge or new player influx, with many high-scoring new accounts appearing
