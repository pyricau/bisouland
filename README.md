# SkySwoon (Bisouland)

SkySwoon (originally Bisouland) is a free browser-based strategy game that turns
romance into competitive gameplay.

Join other players online as you strategically send **Kisses** to capture
**Love Points** and dominate the clouds.

Simple to learn, engaging to master, and completely free to play.

A delightfully retro online strategy game from 2005, lovingly preserved in its
original state. Experience a fascinating time capsule of early web development
and quirky game design.
